# Puyallup Valley JACL website

This is the source code for the Puyallup Valley JACL main website. This site was bootstrapped from [the Astro JS](https://astro.build) website framework and compiles down to static HTML/CSS/Javascript and requires development tools to modify the website

## Required Development tools

Modifying this website requires the following tools on any PC/Mac/Linux computer:

* Complete installation of [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) including the NPM dependency library. Test by typing ```node --version``` into a terminal or command line.
* A fairly modern version of [Git](https://git-scm.org), which might be installed by default on some computers. Test by typing ```git --version``` into any terminal or command line.
* A good code editor to change the code. [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is free and available for Windows/Mac/Linux and many other OSes.

## Built using Astro JS

Technologies used to create this website: 

* This website uses [Astro JS](https://astro.build) to create a static website (HTML, CSS and Javascript files with NO server). 
* All code is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* We use this account's Github Pages address [https://pvjacl.github.io](https://pvjacl.github.io). The combination of naming the repository ```pvjacl.github.io``` and turning on the Github Pages option means that the Pages website will publish the static files located in the ```/docs``` folder.

* [React](https://react.dev) is used for all user interactions with this website. 

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## How To Start Developing the Website

Use ```git``` to clone the source code repository by typing the following line into a terminal. Be sure to choose an appropriate directory where you want to place the source code. The following line will clone the source code into the directory titled ```pvjacl``` (you can choose any directory name that you like here). After that, change to the pvjacl directory and start the build process

```
git clone https://github.com/pvjacl/pvjacl.github.io pvjacl

cd pvjacl
npm run dev
```

At this point, the website will show up on any browser in this computer at http://localhost:4321. Start modifying the source code and watch your changes happen as soon as you save your files. Adding some photos will require that you restart again. Hit ctrl-C (sometimes twice) to quit the development engine, then start it up again with ```npm run dev```.

Once you have everything looking perfectly in the website, you can stop the development engine as above, then next type ```npm run build``` to actually create the static website. 

Now that you've built the static website, all you have to do is to do a GIT commit (using VSCode or via terminal command line) and Git push. Once you push to the origin, your changes will be reflected on the website within minutes.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./docs/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
