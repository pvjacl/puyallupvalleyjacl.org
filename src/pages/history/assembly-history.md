President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. This order allowed the military to create exclusion 
zones to remove all people it chose, thus all Japanese and Japanese Americans were forced from the West Coast and other designated 
areas along the West Coast.

Over 7500 Japanese and Japanese Americans were incarcerated behind barbed wire fencing on the Puyallup Fairgrounds, now known as the 
Washington State Fairgrounds.  The Puyallup Assembly Center was open in April 1942,  when Japanese families from Alaska officially 
changed the fair into the largest concentration camp in Washington State. The majority of the population was from Seattle, but people 
from Fife, and rural areas of Pierce County and were also forced to live in horse stalls and animal pens, along with units in barracks.  
The Puyallup Assembly Center closed in September 1942 but was taken over by soldiers from Ft. Lewis.
 
The Puyallup Assembly Center was nicknamed "Camp Harmony" by an editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 
a local newspaper. The photographer mentioned in his report that the 
people from the Japanese community were quiet and harmonious.  Neither the government or military were opposed to the 
concentration camp being known as a "camp". Thus, the general public was allowed to think the prisoners were camping and 
the nickname that has remained to this day.
